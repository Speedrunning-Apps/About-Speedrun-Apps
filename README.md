# Speedrun Tools
Heyo! Welcome to the Speedrun Tools Organization. This Organization is handled by [icky](https://github.com/ickqy). Here you can find a number of tools that can help speedrunners and speedrun moderators

# Why thou?
This organization was mostly made for MCBE users, because MCBE has more limitations in terms of resources than the JAVA version of the game. But here there is a lot of resources wich can help out all tipeys of users in speedrun.com
